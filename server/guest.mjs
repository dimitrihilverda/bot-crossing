/**
 * The guest API: what a neighbour on the LAN is allowed to see, and the whole of it.
 *
 * A second, separate HTTP server, opened only while sharing is on. Read-only is not a
 * permission check here — it is the shape of the socket. The routes are `/guest/info` and
 * `/guest/threads`, both GET; open, archive, new-session and the colony file simply do not
 * exist on this listener, so there is nothing for a hostile LAN peer to even probe. The
 * owner's own UI keeps living on 127.0.0.1, unreachable from outside.
 *
 * What leaves through here is also stripped: `ref` carries harness session ids and `canOpen`
 * invites a click, and a guest can use neither. Everything else on a thread — title, project,
 * status, timestamps — is exactly what the owner sees, which is what "visiting a colony"
 * means.
