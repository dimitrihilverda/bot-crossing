 *   unread         → stopped and waiting on you, a bobbing `?` — click it to open the thread
 *   long idle      → asleep on the job
 *   anything else  → pottering about its plot
 *
 * Threads group by repo, one repo per hex plot, and every thread gets a building seeded
 * from its own session id — so the colony's skyline is a stable, readable picture of what

  /**
   * Mark a thread's crew member as riding in its car, if it is one that may be hidden.
   *
   * Not a status and not a behaviour. `STATUS_ORDER` is a strict precedence and a seventh
   * state would compete with the six for the badge — a riding crew member is not doing a new
   * thing, it is just not drawn. The agent keeps its slot in the roster, keeps walking and
   * keeps its status; the packing loop in `astronauts.js` steps over it and `_badgeFor` hands
   * back nothing.
   *
   * **The one rule: never suppress a crew member whose status carries a badge.** The badge is
   * what the application promises you can always find. Hide the figure and the badge goes
   * with it (`_badgeFor`) and so does the click target (`astronauts.pick`), so a hidden crew
   * member is a thread you cannot see and cannot open — and the single thread that is asking
   * for you is the one that must never be either.
   *
   * Which way the car is driving is *not* the axis to decide this on, though it looks like
   * it. `_isActive` is `running || unread || hasError`, so a thread that goes quiet sends its
   * car home and parks it; when it next comes back as `unread` — `waiting`, the one `?` that
   * wants you — or `hasError`, the car drives back *out*, and an outbound-only rule blanks
   * that `?` for the three to eight seconds of the drive. The badge is the axis, and it holds
   * on both legs.
   *
   * The cost is a car that sometimes drives with nobody visibly aboard. That is fine: it
   * reads as a van running its own errand. A vanishing `?` does not.
   *
   * Only ever sets the flag. Clearing it is `_updateDeliveries`'s opening sweep, so an entry
   * that stops being visited cannot leave a crew member stranded off screen.
